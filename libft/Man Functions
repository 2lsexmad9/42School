    ft_strdup: Duplicates a string.
    ft_substr: Creates a substring from a string.
    ft_strjoin: Concatenates two strings with a separator.
    ft_split: Splits a string into an array of strings based on a delimiter.
    ft_strtrim: Trims whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.
    ft_striteri: Applies a function to each character of a string with index.
    ft_strmapi: Creates a new string by applying a function to each character of a string with index.

Memory Manipulation

    ft_memcpy: Copies memory area.
    ft_memmove: Copies memory area, handling overlapping regions.
    ft_memchr: Finds the first occurrence of a character in a memory area.
    ft_memcmp: Compares two memory areas.
    ft_memset: Fills a memory area with a specific value.

Input/Output

    ft_putchar_fd: Writes a character to a file descriptor.
    ft_putstr_fd: Writes a string to a file descriptor.
    ft_putendl_fd: Writes a string followed by a newline to a file descriptor.
    ft_putnbr_fd: Writes an integer to a file descriptor.

Type Conversion

    ft_atoi: Converts a string to an integer.
    ft_itoa: Converts an integer to a string.

**Friendly reminder**

This project only has the mandatory part, it can be rewritten for better performance/legibility.
It does not have all the int main or enough tests to prove their efficiency.
It is not the best project around, but overall is better than most in github (without the bonus part).
